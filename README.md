Welcome!

This Repository is for Python Projects that I have coded all with my own knowledge. It contains of many topics like Databases, Data Structures, Algorithms, Texts, API etc. Every time I finish a handful of projects, I will commit and push, so that users like you who enjoy coding in Python can use the repository as a support. Remember, if you are coding ANY project in ANY language, make sure to attempt to build it yourself, then you refer to source code/answer to see how they did it. You don't have to exactly follow their steps, because it's YOUR project for your own learning. In each folder, there'll be a file called "{folder_name}List.txt". This file is what contains a small description of each mini-project within the topic. All these projects come from the Python Course on Udemy. Link will be added when I find it T_T.
